Copyright (c) 2009-2010, Jouni Malinen <j@w1.fi>

See below for more details on licensing and code history.

This has been greatly stripped down from the original file
(upnp_wps_device.c) by Ted Merrill, Atheros Communications
in order to eliminate use of the bulky libupnp library etc.

History:
upnp_wps_device.c is/was a shim layer between wps_opt_upnp.c and
the libupnp library.
The layering (by Sony) was well done; only a very minor modification
to API of upnp_wps_device.c was required.
libupnp was found to be undesirable because:
It consumed too much code and data space
It uses multiple threads, making debugging more difficult
and possibly reducing reliability.
It uses static variables and only supports one instance.
The shim and libupnp are here replaced by special code written
specifically for the needs of hostapd.
Various shortcuts can and are taken to keep the code size small.
Generally, execution time is not as crucial.

BUGS:
UPnP requires that we be able to resolve domain names.
While uncommon, if we have to do it then it will stall the entire
hostapd program, which is bad.
This is because we use the standard linux getaddrinfo() function
which is syncronous.
An asyncronous solution would be to use the free ""ares"" library.
Does not have a robust output buffering scheme.  Uses a single
fixed size output buffer per TCP/HTTP connection, with possible (although
unlikely) possibility of overflow and likely excessive use of RAM.
A better solution would be to write the HTTP output as a buffered stream,
using chunking: (handle header specially, then) generate data with
a printf-like function into a buffer, catching buffer full condition,
then send it out surrounded by http chunking.
There is some code that could be separated out into the common
library to be shared with wpa_supplicant.
Needs renaming with module prefix to avoid polluting the debugger
namespace and causing possible collisions with other static fncs
and structure declarations when using the debugger.
The http error code generation is pretty bogus, hopefully no one cares.

as explained above and below.

See the README file for the current license terms.

This software was previously distributed under BSD/GPL v2 dual license
terms that allowed either of those license alternatives to be
selected. As of February 11, 2012, the project has chosen to use only
the BSD license option for future distribution. As such, the GPL v2
license option is no longer used. It should be noted that the BSD
license option (the one with advertisement clause removed) is compatible
with GPL and as such, does not prevent use of this software in projects
that use GPL.

Some of the files may still include pointers to GPL version 2 license
terms. However, such copyright and license notifications are maintained
only for attribution purposes and any distribution of this software
after February 11, 2012 is no longer under the GPL v2 option."

These programs are licensed under the BSD license (the one with
advertisement clause removed).

If you are submitting changes to the project, please see CONTRIBUTIONS
file for more instructions.

This package may include either wpa_supplicant, hostapd, or both. See
README file respective subdirectories (wpa_supplicant/README or
hostapd/README) for more details.

Source code files were moved around in v0.6.x releases and compared to
earlier releases, the programs are now built by first going to a
subdirectory (wpa_supplicant or hostapd) and creating build
configuration (.config) and running 'make' there (for Linux/BSD/cygwin
builds).

@file pseudofloat.h
@brief Pseudo-floating point
This header file provides a lightweight floating point type for
use on fixed-point platforms when a large dynamic range is
required. The new type is not compatible with the 32-bit IEEE format,
it is not even remotely as accurate as 32-bit floats, and is not
even guaranteed to produce even remotely correct results for code
other than Speex. It makes all kinds of shortcuts that are acceptable
for Speex, but may not be acceptable for your application. You're
quite welcome to reuse this code and improve it, but don't assume
it works out of the box. Most likely, it doesn't.
