 In this example, the mesh is started after power-on. You can refer to the documentation in blemesh_cli to use the app to connect nodes to the network and configure network parameters. If you need to issue control commands, you can use the "gen_cli_send dstaddress" command to send control data to the specified device address or this group of addresses.
