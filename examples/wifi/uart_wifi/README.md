# Low Power Mode Configuration and Usage

## Configuration

To enable low power mode, you need to set the `CONFIG_USE_LPAPP` variable in your configuration. This can be done by uncommenting or adding the following line in your project's configuration file:

```bash
set(CONFIG_USE_LPAPP 1)
```

After making the necessary changes, you need to recompile your project:

```bash
make
```

## Flashing

To flash your project onto the target device, use the following command, where `xxx` is your serial port name:

```bash
make flash COMX=xxx # xxx is your com port name
```

## How to Use PWR Mode

### PWR Mode Commands

Reference: atmoudle.rst

Supported commands for PWR mode are:

- AT+PWR
- AT+DTIM

#### AT+PWR Command

Command Format:

```bash
AT+PWR=<power mode>[,<timeout>][,<level>]
```

Response:

```bash
OK
```

Parameters:

- `<power mode>`:
    - 0: normal mode.
    - 1: hibemate mode.
    - 2: standby mode.

- `<timeout>`: Hold time in low-power mode, in milliseconds.
- `[<level>]`: In hibemate mode, power level ranging from 0 to 2.

#### Examples

```bash
AT+PWR=0                       // Normal mode
AT+PWR=1,1000,0                // Hibemate mode, timeout 1000ms, level 0.
AT+PWR=2,30000000              // Standby mode, timeout 30000000 ms
```

#### AT+SLWKDTIM Command

To set the wakeup DTIM value:

- `<dtim>`: Set the wakeup DTIM.

Example:

```bash
AT+SLWKDTIM=10                      // Set DTIM 10 for wakeup.
```

### Testing PWR Mode

#### Testing PWR Step

1. Use a power analyzer to supply power to the demo board.
2. Reset the demo board.
3. Execute the command `AT+PWR=1,1000,0`
4. You can see that the current has decreased, and then measure the subsequent average power consumption.

#### Testing DTIM Step

1. Use a power analyzer to supply power to the demo board.
2. Reset the demo board.
3. Connect to the Access Point (AP).
4. Send `AT+SLWKDTIM=10`
5. Send `AT+PWR=2,30000` (enter standby mode)
6. You can see that the current has decreased, and then measure the subsequent average power consumption.

### NOTE

If the board is not restarted after exiting due to low power timeout, execute `'spisync_wakeup'` on the Device Under Test (DUT) side first. Then, you can continue using the above commands to test low power.
